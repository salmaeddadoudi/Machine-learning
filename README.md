House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques, particularly the XGBoost algorithm. The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." 

The primary objective is to explore and analyze various features influencing house prices, perform data preprocessing, and implement feature engineering to enhance model performance. The choice of XGBoost is driven by its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and its ability to capture intricate relationships between variables. By participating in this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of predictive modeling, feature engineering, and gain practical experience in leveraging machine learning for real-world problem-solving. This project not only hones my technical skills but also allows me to contribute to the broader data science community by sharing insights and methodologies.
